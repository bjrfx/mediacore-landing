These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of MediaCore (the "Service") provided by MediaCore ("we", "us"). By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy.

If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

## 1. Eligibility & Accounts

## 2. Access, Subscriptions & Limits

- We offer tiered access (e.g., Guest, Free, Premium, Premium Plus, Enterprise) with different features and playback limits.
- Playback time and language access may be restricted per tier. Circumventing limits (e.g., via automation or tampering) is prohibited.
- Tier features, pricing, and availability may change. If billing is offered, subscription terms, charges, taxes, and refund policy will be provided separately.

## 3. Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for unlawful, harmful, fraudulent, infringing, or abusive activities.
- Upload or distribute content you do not have rights to or that violates third‑party intellectual property, privacy, or publicity rights.
- Reverse engineer, interfere with, or attempt to bypass security, playback limits, or access controls.
- Scrape, harvest, or misuse API endpoints or analytics features.
- Transmit malware or disrupt networks or servers.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

## 4. Content & Licenses

- **Your Content:** If you upload media or metadata (e.g., tracks, HLS segments, thumbnails, subtitles), you represent and warrant you have the necessary rights and licenses.
- You grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide license to host, store, reproduce, adapt, and display your content as necessary to operate the Service.
- We may remove or disable content that we reasonably believe violates these Terms or applicable law.

## 5. Analytics & Logging

We log usage data (e.g., IP, user agent, referrer, endpoints accessed, response metrics, geographic attribution) to ensure security, monitor performance, and improve the Service. Admin users may view session data (e.g., last active, device/browser, rough location) for support and moderation.

## 6. Third‑Party Services

The Service may integrate with third‑party services (e.g., Google OAuth). Use of third‑party services is subject to their terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third‑party services.

## 7. Privacy

By using the Service, you agree to our Privacy Policy, which explains how we collect and use data. See the Privacy Policy for details on tokens, logs, analytics, cookies/localStorage, and data rights.

## 8. Changes to the Service

We may update, modify, or discontinue features at any time without liability. We will strive to provide notice of major changes that materially impact users.

## 9. Disclaimers

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error‑free operation.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or loss of data, profits, or business, arising from or related to your use of the Service. Our total liability for any claim will not exceed the amounts paid by you (if any) for the Service during the 12 months prior to the event giving rise to the claim.

## 11. Indemnification

You will indemnify and hold harmless [Company Name], its affiliates, and personnel from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from your content, your use of the Service, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.

## 12. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access immediately if you violate these Terms or if necessary to protect the Service or users. Upon termination, your rights under these Terms will end, but provisions intended to survive (e.g., ownership, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification) will remain in effect.

## 13. Governing Law & Disputes

These Terms are governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict‑of‑laws principles. Exclusive venue for disputes is the courts located in [Venue]. You agree to the jurisdiction of these courts.

## 14. Changes to These Terms
