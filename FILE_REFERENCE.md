## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with START_HERE.md** - Easiest entry point
2. **Copy patterns from routes-example.js** - Don't write from scratch
3. **Test locally before uploading** - Catch issues early
4. **Keep dist/ out of git** - Add to .gitignore
5. **Set env vars in cPanel** - Not in files
6. **Check logs in cPanel** - Easy debugging
